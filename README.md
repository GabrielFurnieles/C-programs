# C-programs
These are some programs created in C during my first programming course.
- **Ahorcado:** Classic hangman game with to options: user vs machine or user1 vs user2 (local).
- **Analisis Noticias:** This code simulates a study about the number of news per week of six trend technologies, showing the total technology news and the average, technologies that appear the most per week, greater increase and trends.
- **Operaciones Matrices:** A code that allows the user to calculate operations with matrices. (Determinant, transposed , inverse, sum, multiplication and division).
- **Pasword:** Basic login system with 3 variable passwords.
- **Primitiva:** Lottery simulator (spanish version "Primitiva"). 

### 📋 Requirements
To run the codes you don't need any specific software, just windows/mac/linux console.

If you want to edit the code then you will need a coding software that supports C language, like CodeBlocks, VisualStudioCode...
